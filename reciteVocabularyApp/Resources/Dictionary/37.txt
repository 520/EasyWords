The measurements of a room or of a rectangular area or object are the length (measured along the longer sides) and the width (measured along the shorter sides) 量度房间或长方形的面积或物体, 用length（长度, 沿较长的边量得）和width（宽度, 沿较短的边量得）表示: The garage is 6 metres long and 3 metres wide. 汽车房长6米, 宽3米. When describing a piece of furniture that has a front and a back, both length and width can be used for the longer sides and depth is used for the measurement from front to back. 在形容一件有前後之分的家具时, length和width均可用以指较长的边, 而depth（深度）则指从前面到後面的尺寸. Length is generally used when the measurement of the front is much greater than that of the depth. 若前面的长短远远超过深度, 一般用length. *Width is used when the measurements of the front and of the depth are similar. 若前面的长短与深度相似, 则用width. (See illustration 见插图. )  2 Compare wide and broad. 试比较wide和broad. Wide is the more general word but broad is used of parts of the body *wide适用范围较广, broad则特指身体的部位: a broad nose 大鼻子 *  broad shoulders 宽阔的双肩. Otherwise it is more formal than wide and is often used, especially in literary language, to describe features of the landscape 在其他情况下, broad比wide更文雅, 尤其在文学语言中常用以描绘景色: a broad river 宽阔的河 *  a broad expanse of unspoilt country 一片广袤的、 自然美未受破坏的郊野.
