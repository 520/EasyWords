NOTE ON USAGE 用法: Compare sell, vend, peddle, push and flog. 试比较sell、 vend、 peddle、 push、 flog这几个词.  1 Sell is the most general verb, meaning `give in exchange for money' *sell使用最广, 意为｀拿东西换钱＇: They are selling their house and moving to the country. 他们打算把房子卖掉, 搬到乡下去. * Do you sell magazines here? 你们这儿卖杂志吗?2 Vend is formal and indicates the selling of small articles. *vend较文, 指出售小件商品. The noun vendor is much more common than the verb 由这个动词派生出的名词vendor, 比其动词本身较为常用: a street vendor, a news-vendor 街上的摊贩、 报贩. It is also a legal term used especially in the selling of a house *vendor还是个法律术语, 用以指房产的卖方: The vendor signs a contract with the purchaser. 卖方须与买方签订契约.

It often suggests that what is to be sold is of little value, possibly stolen and therefore difficult to sell 这个词常指出售的东西无甚价值, 或可为赃物, 故难以售出: He tried to flog me a broken TV set. 他一个劲儿向我兜售一个破电视机.
